  If configured, Jenkins will send out an notification to the specified recipients
  when a certain important event occurs.

  <ol>
    <li>Every failed build triggers a new notification.
    <li>A successful build after a failed (or unstable) build triggers a notification,
        indicating that a crisis is over.
    <li>An unstable build after a successful build triggers a new notification,
        indicating that there's a regression.
    <li>Unless configured, every unstable build triggers a new notification,
        indicating that regression is still there.
  </ol>
